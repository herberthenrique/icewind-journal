# Chronicles

## A New Crew, Old Troubles 

[[Characters/Players/Pipper\|Pipper]] and [[Characters/Players/Drek Thar\|Drek Thar]] reunites with Hlin in Bryn Shander. The seasoned adventurer reiterates her offer to investigate the mysterious murders plaguing the city. 

## Loss and pain
[[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Bremen/Cora Mulphoon\|Cora Mulphoon]], the innkeeper the party met previously, approaches the group as they prepare to leave for Targos. She is visibly distressed and shares a concerning story about her son, [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Caer Dineval/Huarwar Mulphoon\|Huarwar Mulphoon]]

Huarwar went missing after a blizzard and returned changed, exhibiting aggressive behavior and possessing a strange shard of black ice. Subsequently, two tieflings convinced him to join them at a sanctuary in either Caer-Dineval or Caer-Konig.

Cora is desperate to find her son and asks the party to deliver a message to him if they encounter him: that she misses him deeply and loves him unconditionally. She offers free food and lodging at her inn in return for their help.

## The Long night
 The group decides to head to Targos, a central hub for travelers, to regroup and plan their next steps.

Targos, a bustling town, is filled with both departing and arriving adventurers. The party finds a suitable lodging at the Three Flags Sailing Inn, owned by the friendly Ma. As they settle in, they hear rumors of invisible thieves plaguing Caer Konig.

A local dwarf, proud of his newly forged axe, attracts a small crowd of admirers. Amidst the commotion, the party notices [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Targos/Torrga Icevein\|Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Targos/Torrga Icevein]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Misc/Sephek Kaltro\|Sephek Kaltro]], the focus of their original investigation. With a plan in place, they assign Ronnie the stealthy task of following Sephek.

Sephek was ready to make one more kill, Ronnie tries to interrupt, but unfortunately, a miscalculation leads to Ronnie capturing the wrong person, interrupting Sephek's villainous monologue. The rest of the party arrives, struggles to deal with the unexpected magical defenses, but Sephek is finally defeated.
