# Chronicles

## Cold Open
Icewind Dale has become trapped in a perpetual winter. Ferocious blizzards make the mountain pass through the Spine of the World exceedingly treacherous, and this land has not felt the warmth of the sun in over two years. In fact, the sun no longer appears above the mountains, not even in what should be the height of summer. In this frozen tundra, darkness and bitter cold reign as king and queen. Most dale residents blame Auril the Frostmaiden, the god of winter’s wrath. The shimmering aurora that weaves across the sky each night is said to be her doing—a potent spell that keeps the sun at bay.

Dalefolk live in a scattering of settlements known as Ten-Towns. The drop-off in caravans coming from the south and travel between settlements in this never-ending winter has left everyone feeling isolated. Although each town has resolved to appease the Frostmaiden with sacrifices of one kind or another, no respite from winter’s fury seems forthcoming. For adventurers such as yourselves, Ten-Towns is a place to test one’s mettle and, in the spirit of heroes who have come before, leave one’s mark on this frigid, blighted land.

##  Cold-Hearted-Killer
The adventure begins in the bustling city of [[Places/Ten Towns/Bryn Shander\|Bryn Shander]], a rare Ten-Towns settlement not nestled on the icy shores of Lake Ten-Eyes. It's here that the party is approached by a grizzled shield dwarf named [[Hlin\|Hlin]]. A woman of age and experience, she's disturbed by a series of murders that have gripped the city. Despite the cold indifference many show towards the victims, Hlin believes there's more to these deaths than meets the eye.

A mysterious figure named [[Characters/NPCs/Misc/Sephek Kaltro\|Sephek Kaltro]], a bodyguard for the wealthy merchant company Torga's, lead by [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Targos/Torg\|Torg]] has caught Hlin's attention. His unusual attire and aloof demeanor suggest a connection to the city's growing troubles. Some whisper he's a devotee of Auriel, the sun god, making sacrifices on nights of the new moon. A theory emerges: perhaps the victims are somehow avoiding being chosen as sacrifices.

Intrigued by the promise of 75 gold pieces for dealing with Sephek, the party agrees to investigate. As luck would have it, Torga's company is headed to Bremen, a town further south. The party decides to follow, hoping to catch Sephek off guard.

## Lake Monster
Bremen, a dwarven settlement on the Maer Dualdon river, is shrouded in its own mysteries. Recent disappearances and strange occurrences near the river have the townsfolk on edge. The local leader, [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Bremen/Dorbulgruf Shalescar\|Dorbulgruf Shalescar]], has experienced peculiar memory lapses, wandering the riverbank without recollection.

The party finds work as fishermen, a convenient disguise to explore the area. Strange occurrences continue: a frost-bearded humanoid mistakes them for locals, and a shark-like creature damages a boat. A knowledgeable half-elf named Tali warns them of a dangerous blade-like creature lurking in the lake, attacking boats from Bremen.

To gain more information, the party agrees to accompany a fishing expedition onto the frozen lake. As they wait for a catch, a colossal, intelligent creature surfaces from the depths - a Placesaurus! After a tense encounter, they learn the beast has been mind-controlled by a human servant of [[Characters/Gods and Powers/Auril\|Auril]], Ravizin. The Placesaurus, once a wise creature, now seeks to destroy Bremen at Ravizin's command.

Returning to shore, the party shares their findings with the townsfolk but receives little reward for their efforts. The trail of Sephek and Torga leads them further south, towards the city of [[Places/Ten Towns/Caer Konig\|Caer Konig]].
