# Session 3 - The Mountain Climb
# Chronicles

### Aftermath 
The aftermath of the confrontation with Sephek is grim. His body remains as evidence. The gnome victim, still in shock, watches as the party takes Sephek's head out. A discussion ensues about their next steps, including how someone can possibly manipulate the sacrifice system with bribes. 
A mysterious symbol is discovered, maybe hinting at a larger conspiracy?

Leaving Targos, the party encounters a lost dog named Boy. They take care of the animal and follow it to its home. The grateful [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Targos/Keegan Velryn\|Keegan Velryn]] owner reveals that her husband, [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Targos/Garret Velryn\|Garret Velryn]], an adventurer, was hired to explore [[Places/Kelvin's Cairn\|Kelvin's Cairn]] near [[Places/Ten Towns/Caer Konig\|Caer Konig]]. In exchange for helping find Garret, his partner offers the party free lodging and artwork for The Luskan Arms in Bryn Shander.

### Rewards & Travel
Returning to Bryn Shander, the party presents [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Bryn Shander/Hlin Trollbane\|Hlin Trollbane]] with the evidence against Sephek, earning a reward of 65 gold pieces each. 
They acquire walking and supplies for the journey to [[Places/Ten Towns/Caer Dineval\|Caer Dineval]], a stepping stone to [[Places/Ten Towns/Caer Konig\|Caer Konig]]

Boy, the dog, leads the party to a specific location, where they find evidence of Garret's presence and people how helped him: [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Caer Konig/Atenas Swift\|Atenas Swift]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Caer Konig/Jarthra Farzassh\|Jarthra Farzassh]]

The group decides to hire [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Caer Konig/Jarthra Farzassh\|Jarthra Farzassh]] as a guide and embark on the perilous climb. As soon as they arrive in the camp location, the party find another dogs 

### The Fallen Climber

A sudden avalanche separates the party, with Ronrom and Ronnie buried in the snow. The hope was into one single rope that could them to not get lost to each other and could survive the snow.

Thanks to [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Targos/Boy\|Boy]], they could find a hurt [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Targos/Garret Velryn\|Garret Velryn]] that warns the party about his group being attack by Yetis and how he barely survived.  Known to Ten-Towners as **“Hunters of Men”** two crag cats caught Garret’s scent but failed to reach him before the characters showed up. The Party could easily defeat one of them giving fear to the other that run away. 

Garret describes the missing explorers as follows:
- [[Characters/NPCs/Misc/Mokingo Growling Bear Akannathi\|Mokingo Growling Bear Akannathi]], a male goliath warrior determined to find Oyaminartok and test his mettle against her
- [[Characters/NPCs/Ten Towns/Bryn Shander/Perilou  Fishfinger\|Perilou  Fishfinger]], a female lightfoot halfling follower of Yondalla (halfling god of fertility and protection) and Mokingo’s stalwart companion
- [[Characters/NPCs/Misc/Astrix\|Astrix]], a female tiefling who mumbles and swears a lot (Garret doesn’t know what her story is)

### Frozen Cave
Finally after some hours climbing, the party reached the frozen cave nearby where Garret party's was attacked. Entering the cave they discovers a tragic scene: the dead body of [[Characters/NPCs/Misc/Mokingo Growling Bear Akannathi\|Mokingo Growling Bear Akannathi]].
ut they could see have a a baby Yeti "playing" with Perilou, one of Garret's companions while it's mother Yeti was watching. 


This cave contains a strange sight: a female adult yeti watching her child, a yeti tyke, as it plays with a lightfoot halfling dressed in cold weather clothing and curled up in the fetal position. The halfling is Perilou Fishfinger. The yeti tyke is knocking her around like a ball, and it’s clear from her cries that Perilou is still alive. 

The appearance of intruders terrifies the yeti tyke, which crawls up onto its mother’s back to get away from them. The mother lets out a roar, hoping to scare off the intruders without a fight. In this moment, they can save the cleric, as the mother Yeti was focused into protecting her child.

As the party leave the yeti cave, the male adult Yeti returns home with a dead mountain goat tucked under one arm and start attacking the party that was leaving his home. After a long fight they could defeat the Yeti and save their skins of a tragic end.

The rescue mission has only just begun, with the party facing increasingly dangerous challenges in the icy wilderness.
