## Combat
- **Potions** 
	- Potions may be *self*-administered with a bonus action. Using your full action will automatically maximize the efficacy of the potion (i.e. max roll).

## Inspiration

### Usage
Inspiration can be used after the roll to roll again and use the highest value

### How to receive recognition
- At beginning of every season, each player will receive 2 inspiration tokens
- Players can use these tokens to give to any other player for a moment you enjoyed or believe deserves recognition
- After a player receive 4 inspiration tokens, the player receives a Inspiration point.
	- The tokens received at the beginning at the session will not count for this.
- Each player can have up to 2 inspirations at same time
- The DM will count the inspiration tokens for each player
-  At the end of the session, the DM will get all unused inspiration tokens.
- The received inspirations tokens accumulate from one session to another.


## Spellcasting


## Character Building
- **Feats are allowed**. Feats are allowed in place of Ability Score Improvements.
- **Multi-classing is allowed**

 
## Backpack
- **Encumbrance & Carrying Capacity.** Track normal Encumbrance, but we won't hyper focus on it. Be pragmatic.
- **Money and Loot.** Track your loot. Gold and silver currencies will be used (1gp = 10sp). Other valuable loot like gems may be assigned a currency value and immediately liquidated. Others might need to be actively sold.

## General
- **Quick rulings!** We'll make quick rulings for most rule disputes. Make a note of the questions for later, so we can get a proper ruling for future cases.
- **Rule of Cool.** THE RULE OF COOL WINS!
