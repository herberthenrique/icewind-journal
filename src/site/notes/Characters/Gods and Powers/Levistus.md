>[!info]
> Levistus was the Lord of Stygia, the fifth layer of the Nine Hells, a wasteland of ice.
> The self-titled "prince" was known for his treachery and was imprisoned in an ancient iceberg, often referred to as his tomb. 
> Levistus's true appearance was widely unknown, as from the outside of his glacial prison he could only be seen as a small black blot a quarter-mile within the mountain of dark ice. 
> In the days of his freedom, he wore loose, silken clothing and carried a shining rapier, now donning fanciful garments and other finery when meeting mortals in projected form. His holy symbol was a black sword embedded in ice.
