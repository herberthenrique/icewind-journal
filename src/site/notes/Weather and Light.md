# Weather Hex Flower

## How it works

1. Determine your starting hex. It might be whatever the last weather event was in your story, or a blizzard if you’ve come out of quest.
2. Roll 2d6 to determine direction per the key in the top right.
3. Move to the next hex using the direction you just determined.
4. Determine how long you’d like this weather event to last. At my table all weathers last for the day of travel except blizzards which last 4 hours.
5. Repeat steps 2-4.

## Weather effects

These weather events also have specific effects, feel free to use these if you like them too:

### Heavy snow

# Daytime Light
![_attachments/time_and_light.png](/img/user/_attachments/time_and_light.png)

**10 AM to 2 PM**: Dim Light due to a "risen" sun that never actually gets above the horizon (just like in winter)

**2 PM to 12 AM**: Darkness with clouds and/or starlight

**12 AM to 10 AM**: Auril's aurora that lights up the night sky, but not expressly enough to produce Dim Light so it's likely still Darkness
